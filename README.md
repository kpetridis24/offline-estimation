Uncertain parameter estimation on Grey-Box Dynamic Systems

The systems modeled and simulated under this project are

- Mass-spring-Damper Dynamic System
- RLC circuit Dynamic System

After modeling each system and formulating the mathematical desription such that they are solvable by the 
**Least Squares** method, the uncertain parameters are estimated via minimization of the error between
the model and the real system. All analysis regarding the simulations, the theoretical mathematical backround,
the precision of the results, and their sensitivity after inserting false, outlier values into the measurements 
are all extensively discussed topics of the report paper.
